# Userspace

Files to communicate with FPGA synthetized hardware using the *mem* device located in */dev/mem*. This applications were made for testing the communication with the IP components from userspace.

## Custom LEDs

Userspace app that comunicates with the LEDs connected to the FPGA in the DE0 Nano SoC development board. 
For more documentation read the README.md file inside the custom_leds folder.

## Avalon LEDs

Userspace app that comunicates with the LEDs connected to the FPGA in the DE0 Nano SoC development board. For more documentation read the README.md file inside the avalon_leds folder.

## Avalon PWM

Userspace app that comunicates with the PWM modules in the FPGA. For more documentation read the README.md file inside the avalon_pwm folder.

## Avalon Encoder

Userspace app that comunicates with the quadrature encoder modules in the FPGA. For more documentation read the README.md file inside the avalon_encoder folder.

## Avalon Control

Userspace app that comunicates with the PID controller modules in the FPGA. For more documentation read the README.md file inside the avalon_control folder.
